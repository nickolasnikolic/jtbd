# Jobs to be Done Web App (JTBD)

The jtbd web app is a small app being developed in angular for compiling useful lists of jtbd.

It's not finished. Just something that I am throwing together over the holidays 2014 or so to be useful to others.

Currently only a shell. I wouldn't download unless you would like to finish it for me ;-)
